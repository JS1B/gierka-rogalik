This repo contains a simple, 2d, example game that would showcase how the technologies involved can be used. It is more of a learning project than anything else.

## How to

To run the app you need to copy **dev.env** to **.env** and fill out all of the fields with required data.

```
cp dev.env .env
<fill .env>
docker compose up --build
```

You can individually run the game and the server. See [game](game/README.md) and [server](server/README.md).
